\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The discovery of a Higgs ($\PHiggs$) boson by the ATLAS and CMS experiments~\cite{Higgs-Discovery_ATLAS,Higgs-Discovery_CMS}
represents a major step towards our understanding of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB),
as well as of the mechanism that generates the masses of quarks and leptons, 
the particles that constitute the `` ordinary'' matter in our universe.
In a combined analysis of the data recorded by ATLAS and CMS during LHC Run $1$, 
the mass of the $\PHiggs$ boson has been measured to be $125.09 \pm 0.24$~\GeV~\cite{HIG-14-042}.
Recent analyses of data collected during LHC Run $2$ corroborate this value~\cite{HIG-16-041,Aaboud:2018wps}.
The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics makes precise predictions for all properties of the $\PHiggs$ boson, given its mass. 
The predictions have been probed by measurements of its spin and CP quantum numbers~\cite{HIG-14-018,Aad:2015mxa,Aad:2016nal},
of its couplings to gauge bosons and to down-type fermions~\cite{HIG-15-002},
and of its total decay width, including decays to invisible particles~\cite{HIG-13-030,HIG-14-032,Aad:2015pla}.
So far, all measured properties of the discovered particle are consistent with the expectation for a SM $\PHiggs$ boson 
within the uncertainties of these measurements.
Evidence for its coupling to up-type fermions, at a strength compatible with the SM expectation, has been observed recently~\cite{Aaboud:2018urx,HIG-17-035}.

The SM predicts $\PHiggs$ boson self-interactions via trilinear and quadlinear couplings. 
Measurements of the $\PHiggs$ boson self-interactions will allow to determine the potential of the $\PHiggs$ field,
thereby ultimately either confirming or falsifying that the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism of the SM is responsible for EWSB.
The trilinear coupling ($\lambdaHHH$) can be determined at the LHC, by measuring the rate for $\PHiggs$ boson pair production ($\dihiggs$)\footnote{The measurement of the quadlinear coupling is not possible at the LHC, 
even with the $3000$~fb$^{-1}$ of data foreseen to be recorded at $\sqrt{s}=14$~\TeV center-of-mass energy during the upcoming HL-LHC data-taking period~\cite{Cepeda:2019klc}[CV: NEED REFERENCE. \textcolor{red}{X: I am not sure what you wanted to reference, that is my guess}],
as the cross section of the corresponding process triple $\PHiggs$ boson production, is much too small, 
on the level of $5 \cdot 10^{-2}$~\cite{Plehn:2005nk,Binoth:2006ym}. }. 
In analogy to the production of single $\PHiggs$ bosons, 
four different processes are relevant for $\dihiggs$ production at the LHC: 
gluon fusion ($\ggHH$), vector boson fusion ($\qqHH$), the associated production with a $\PW$ or $\PZ$ boson ($\VHH$, also referred to as ``Higgsstrahlung''),
and associated production of the $\PHiggs$ boson pair with a pair of top quarks ($\ttHH$). The cross sections for the $\qqHH$, $\VHH$, and $\ttHH$ process are more than one order of magnitude smaller than  $\ggHH$ (see for example~\cite{Baglio:2012np}).
As the sensitivity of experimental analyses at the LHC is limited by the small signal rate at present,
we will focus on the $\ggHH$ production process in this paper.

The total $\dihiggs$ production rate is dominated by the $\ggHH$ process.
The cross section for the latter has been computed at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in quantum chromodynamics,
with resummation of soft gluon contributions at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy.
Including corrections for finite top quark mass effects, computed at next-to-leading order (NLO),
it amounts to $31.05^{+7.04}_{-5.42}$~fb~\cite{Grazzini:2018bsd}.
The cross section is rather small, as this is a loop induced process
The leading order (LO) Feynman diagrams for the two mechanisms are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ggHH_FeynmanDiagram}.
The left diagram, referred to as ``box'' diagram, does actually not depend on the trilinear $\PHiggs$ boson self-coupling $\lambdaHHH$.
The diagram that provides the sensitivity to $\lambdaHHH$ is the ``triangle'' diagram shown on the right.
Both diagrams depend on the coupling of the $\PHiggs$ boson to the top quark, denoted by the symbol $\yt$,
which is measured with an uncertainty of order $10\%$ at present~\cite{Aaboud:2018urx,HIG-17-035}. The two kinds of processes on figure~\ref{fig:ggHH_FeynmanDiagram} interfere with each other at the point that small deviations on either $\lambda$ or of the Higgs boson coupling to quarks results on sizable modifications on the predicted kinematic distributions and large variations on the total cross section, arriving to 100 times the SM prediction. If there is, for example, an extended symmetry on nature or the existence of very heavy particles (beyond few teW scale) new kinds of interaction can appear in the low energy effectve lagrangian, as the contact interaction of one or two Higgs bosos with a pair of gluons and/or the contact interation of two Higgs boson to a pair of top quark. In the case that those Beyond the SM (BSM) couplings generate more processes that also interfere with the above mentioned SM-like production modes, larger cross section enhancements and even more sizable kinematics modifications for the $\ggHH$ process can happen (see for example~\cite{Carvalho:2015ttv}).

The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have searched for non-resonant $\dihiggs$ production in the decay channels 
$\dihiggs \to \Pbottom\Pbottom\Pbottom\Pbottom$, $\Pbottom\Pbottom\Pgt\Pgt$, $\Pbottom\Pbottom\PW\PW^{*}$, $\Pbottom\Pbottom\Pgamma\Pgamma$
using the data recorded during LHC Runs $1$ and $2$~\cite{HIG-13-032,HIG-15-013,HIG-17-030,Aad:2015xja,Aaboud:2018knk,Aaboud:2018ftw,Aaboud:2018sfw,Aaboud:2018zhh}.
ATLAS has further performed searches in the decay channels $\dihiggs \to \Pgamma\Pgamma\PW\PW^{*}$ and $\PW\PW^{*}\PW\PW^{*}$~\cite{Aad:2015xja,Aaboud:2018ewm,Aaboud:2018ksn}.
Phenomenological studies of non-resonant $\dihiggs$ production are presented in 
Refs.~\cite{Baur:2002rb,Baur:2002qd,Baur:2003gpa,Baur:2003gp,Dolan:2012rv,Papaefstathiou:2012qe,Baglio:2012np,deLima:2014dta,Wardrope:2014kya,Behr:2015oqq,Li:2015yia,Adhikary:2017jtu}.
No evidence for a signal has been found in the LHC data so far.
The present analyses are able to probe the existence of a SM-like $\dihiggs$ signal produced with a cross section of order $10$ times the SM production rate.  With a combination of all the above mentined channels the CMS collaboration had preliminary exploited the anomalous couplings scenario by use of representative shape benchmarks~\cite{Carvalho:2015ttv} and can exclude a range of cross sections for the process $pp\to HH$ between 100~fb and 3~pb, depending on the predicted shape of the signal~\cite{Sirunyan:2018two}.

For SM-like signal the decay channels providing the highest sensitivity is the $\Pbottom\Pbottom\Pgt\Pgt$ channel in case of ATLAS and the $\Pbottom\Pbottom\Pgamma\Pgamma$ channel in case of CMS.
Both channels provide a favorable signal-to-background ratio and are limited mainly by statistical uncertainties at present,
resulting from the limited amount of data recorded so far compared to the small SM $\ggHH$ production cross section.
The channels $\Pbottom\Pbottom\Pbottom\Pbottom$ and $\Pbottom\Pbottom\PW\PW^{*}$ provide a significantly larger signal rate,
but suffer from sizeable backgrounds,
arising from QCD multijet production in case of the $\Pbottom\Pbottom\Pbottom\Pbottom$ channel 
and from $\ttbar$ production in case of the $\Pbottom\Pbottom\PW\PW^{*}$ channel. In this paper we are interested on the $\Pbottom\Pbottom\PW\PW^{*}$ channel.   %  Although there are techniques proposed to overcome this problem [some references] we ......\textcolor{red}{why do we want to add one more revolutionary way}

The separation of the $\dihiggs$ signal from the large $\ttbar$ background constitutes the main experimental challenge in the $\Pbottom\Pbottom\PW\PW^{*}$ channel.
The $\ttbar$ background is irreducible in this channel, as it produces the exact same multiplicity of charged leptons, neutrinos, and $\Pbottom$-jets as the $\dihiggs$ signal.
In this paper, we focus on events in which the charge leptons are electrons or muons and use the symbol $\Plepton$ to refer to either an electron or a muon.
The LO Feynman diagram for $\ttbar$ production is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ttbar_FeynmanDiagram}.
The main handle to separate the signal from the background is the difference in event kinematics,
that is, the differences in the distributions of energies and angles of the charged leptons, $\Pbottom$-jets, and of the missing transverse momentum reconstructed in the event.
The present CMS analysis~\cite{HIG-17-006} utilizes multivariate methods,  based on a Deep Neural network,
to separate the $\dihiggs$ signal from the $\ttbar$ background, while the current ATLAS analysis~\cite{Aaboud:2018zhh} employs a sequence of hard cuts for this purpose.
In this paper, we propose an alternative multivariate method for the separation of the $\dihiggs$ signal from the $\ttbar$ background,
the matrix element method (MEM)~\cite{Kondo:1988yd,Kondo:1991dw} and apply it to events in which both $\PW$ bosons decay to charged leptons.

The MEM is almost ideally suited for the application to the $\Pbottom\Pbottom\PW\PW^{*}$ channel.
Its advantage is to make optimal use of the kinematical information available in each event,
while the presence of a single dominant and furthermore irreducible background significantly reduces the complexity of the work required to use the MEM. 
Still, two potential difficulties exist for the application of the MEM to the $\Pbottom\Pbottom\PW\PW^{*}$ channel at the LHC.
First, the large cross section for $\ttbar$ production at the LHC implies that experimental analyses need to compute the MEM for several millions of events,
a task that represents a significant computational challenge even for the most modern large-scale computing systems. \textcolor{red}{X: I did not understood the second dificulty, I understood a problem caused by an approximation due the 'first' dificulty.}

In order to reduce the demand for computing time,
we will use LO matrix elements for the $\dihiggs$ signal and for the $\ttbar$ background in this paper.
The LO matrix elements neglect the occurrence of initial and final state radiation.  \textcolor{red}{X: It is not clear here if we use shower, NLO is not only about radiation.} 
In particular for processes predominantly mediated by gluons, such as $\dihiggs$ and $\ttbar$ production,
initial state radiation (ISR) is typically substantial at the LHC~\cite{Alwall:2010cq},
causing extra jets to be produced and the transverse momentum balance of the event to get distorted compared to the expectation obtained from using LO matrix elements. \st{,constituting the second difficulty.}
We will discuss the solutions to \st{both difficulties} \textcolor{blue}{how to improve computing time and improve the simulation approximations} in more detail in the following. \textcolor{red}{X: I did not recognized a discussion of solution to the LO on the rest of the text approximation, BTW I think we have a language problem.} 

For experimental analyses of $\dihiggs$ production in the channel $\Pbottom\Pbottom\PW\PW^{*}$ at the LHC,
we envisage that the result of the MEM, computed event-by-event as described in this paper, 
is used as an input to a multivariate method (MVA) 
with the aim of improving in particular the separation of the signal from the subdominant backgrounds with the aid of the MVA.  

The paper is organized as follows:
In Section~\ref{sec:mem} we describe the MEM and its application to the $\Pbottom\Pbottom\PW\PW^{*}$ channel.
The performance achieved in separating the SM-like $\dihiggs$ signal from the $\ttbar$ background is studied in Section~\ref{sec:performance}. 
\textcolor{red}{X: after we plan BSM? otherwise there was no point in introducing Higgs anomalous couplings with so many details -- BTW if we keep it I would separate it in a section, it is too detailed to an introduction.} 
We summarize our findings in Section~\ref{sec:summary}.

\textcolor{red}{X: For the SM there is already a NLO + to mass affects model, do we want to use it? I see after that not, but we should at least mention it at some point. The modifications are not much on mhh, but sizeable on the pthh spectra, comment something on those lines somewhere}
