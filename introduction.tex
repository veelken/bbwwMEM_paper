\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The discovery of a Higgs ($\PHiggs$) boson by the ATLAS and CMS experiments~\cite{Higgs-Discovery_ATLAS,Higgs-Discovery_CMS}
represents a major step towards our understanding of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB),
as well as of the mechanism that generates the masses of quarks and leptons, 
the particles that constitute the `` ordinary'' matter in our universe.
In a combined analysis of the data recorded by ATLAS and CMS during LHC Run $1$, 
the mass of the $\PHiggs$ boson has been measured to be $125.09 \pm 0.24$~\GeV~\cite{HIG-14-042}.
Recent analyses of data collected during LHC Run $2$ corroborate this value~\cite{ATLAS:2020coj,CMS:2020xrn}.
The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics makes precise predictions for all properties of the $\PHiggs$ boson, given its mass. 
The predictions have been probed by measurements of its spin and CP quantum numbers~\cite{HIG-14-018,Aad:2015mxa,ATLAS:2020evk},
of its couplings to gauge bosons and to down-type fermions~\cite{HIG-15-002},
and of its total decay width, including decays to invisible particles~\cite{CMS:2018yfx,CMS:2019ekd,Aad:2015pla}.
So far, all measured properties of the discovered particle are consistent with the expectation for a SM $\PHiggs$ boson 
within the uncertainties of these measurements.
Evidence for its coupling to up-type fermions, at a strength compatible with the SM expectation, has been observed recently~\cite{Aaboud:2018urx,HIG-17-035}.

The SM predicts $\PHiggs$ boson self-interactions via trilinear and quartic couplings. 
Measurements of the $\PHiggs$ boson self-interactions will allow to determine the potential of the $\PHiggs$ field,
thereby ultimately either confirming or falsifying that the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism of the SM is responsible for EWSB.
The measurement of the quartic coupling is not possible at the LHC~\cite{deFlorian:2019app}, 
even with the $3000$~fb$^{-1}$ of data foreseen to be recorded at $\sqrt{s}=14$~\TeV center-of-mass energy during the upcoming HL-LHC data-taking period~\cite{HL-LHC-TDR},
as the cross section of the corresponding process, triple $\PHiggs$ boson production, is much too small, 
on the level of $5 \cdot 10^{-2}$~\fb~\cite{Plehn:2005nk,Binoth:2006ym}.

The trilinear coupling ($\lambdaHHH$) can be determined at the LHC, by measuring the rate for $\PHiggs$ boson pair production ($\dihiggs$). 
In analogy to the production of single $\PHiggs$ bosons, 
four different processes are relevant for $\dihiggs$ production at the LHC: 
gluon fusion ($\ggHH$), vector boson fusion ($\qqHH$), the associated production with a $\PW$ or $\PZ$ boson ($\VHH$),
and associated production of the $\PHiggs$ boson pair with a pair of top quarks ($\ttHH$).
The total $\dihiggs$ production rate is dominated by the $\ggHH$ process.
The cross section for the latter has been computed at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD),
with resummation of soft gluon contributions at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy.
Including corrections for finite top quark mass effects, computed at next-to-leading order (NLO),
the SM cross section for the $\ggHH$ process amounts to $31.05^{+1.40}_{-1.98}$~\fb at $\sqrt{s} = 13$~\TeV center-of-mass energy~\cite{Grazzini:2018hh}.
The cross section is rather small, as the production of $\PHiggs$ boson pairs through gluon fusion is a loop induced process,
and is further reduced by the negative interference of two competing production mechanisms.
The leading order (LO) Feynman diagrams for the two $\ggHH$ production mechanisms are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ggHH_FeynmanDiagram}.
The right diagram, referred to as the ``box'' diagram, does actually not depend on the trilinear $\PHiggs$ boson self-coupling $\lambdaHHH$.
The diagram that provides the sensitivity to $\lambdaHHH$ is the ``triangle'' diagram shown on the left.
Both diagrams depend on the coupling of the $\PHiggs$ boson to the top quark, denoted by the symbol $\yt$,
which is measured with an uncertainty of order $10\%$ at present~\cite{Aaboud:2018urx,HIG-17-035}.
The cross sections for the $\qqHH$, $\VHH$, and $\ttHH$ process are more than one order of magnitude smaller~\cite{Baglio:2012np}.
As the sensitivity of experimental analyses at the LHC is limited by the small signal rate at present,
we will focus on the $\ggHH$ production process in this paper.

The $\dihiggs$ production rate may be enhanced significantly in case an as yet unknown resonance decays to pairs of $\PHiggs$ bosons.
Such resonances are predicted in models with two Higgs doublets~\cite{Craig:2013hca,Nhung:2013lpa}, composite $\PHiggs$ boson models~\cite{Grober:2010yv,Contino:2010mh}, 
Higgs portal models~\cite{Englert:2011yb,No:2013wsa}, and models involving extra dimensions~\cite{Randall:1999ee}.
In the absence of new resonances decaying into $\PHiggs$ boson pairs,
the $\dihiggs$ production cross section may be enhanced by deviations of the couplings $\lambdaHHH$ and $\yt$ from the SM expectation for these couplings
and by the contribution of new particles to the loops 
that are present in the triangle and box diagrams shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ggHH_FeynmanDiagram}.
%The effect of contributions from new particles to these loops can adequately be described by anomalous $\PHiggs$ boson couplings.
%More specifically,
%the production of $\PHiggs$ boson pairs via gluon fusion in Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) theories can be described to leading approximation by the non-linear Lagrangian~\cite{Buchmuller:1985jz}:
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\mathcal{L} & = & \frac{1}{2} \partial_{\mu}\PHiggs\partial^{\mu}\PHiggs - \frac{1}{2} m_{\PHiggs}^{2} \PHiggs^{2} - \kappa_{\lambda} \lambdaHHH^{\textrm{SM}} v \PHiggs^{3} \nonumber \\
% & & \quad -\frac{m_{\Ptop}}{v} \, \left( v + \kappa_{\Ptop} \PHiggs + \frac{c_{2}}{v} \PHiggs\PHiggs \right) \, \left( \bar{\Ptop}_{\textrm{L}} \Ptop_{\textrm{R}} + \textrm{h.c.} \right) 
%+ \frac{1}{4} \frac{\alpha_{\textrm{s}}}{3 \pi v} \, \left( c_{\Pgluon} \PHiggs - \frac{c_{2\Pgluon}}{2 v} \PHiggs\PHiggs \right) \, \textrm{G}^{\mu\nu}\textrm{G}_{\mu\nu} \, ,
%\end{eqnarray}
%where $v = 246$~\GeV denotes the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field
%and the parameters $\kappa_{\lambda} = \lambdaHHH/\lambdaHHH^{\textrm{SM}}$ and $\kappa_{\Ptop} = \yt/\yt^{\textrm{SM}}$ 
%quantify the deviations of the trilinear $\PHiggs$ boson self-coupling and of the coupling of the $\PHiggs$ boson to the top quark from their SM values.
%Besides the two parameters $\kappa_{\lambda}$ and $\kappa_{\Ptop}$,
%the Lagrangian contains the coefficients of three BSM operators which account for contact interactions 
%between a $\PHiggs$ boson and either one ($c_{\Pgluon}$) or two ($c_{2\Pgluon}$) gluons
%and between a pair of $\PHiggs$ bosons and a pair of top quarks ($c_{2}$).
%The contact interactions can be interpreted in an effective field theory (EFT) approach~\cite{Buchalla:2015wfa, Goertz:2014qta}.
The effect of contributions from new particles to these loops can adequately be described by anomalous $\PHiggs$ boson couplings
in an effective field theory (EFT) approach~\cite{Buchalla:2015wfa, Goertz:2014qta}.
The production of $\PHiggs$ boson pairs in the absence of new resonances is referred to as non-resonant $\dihiggs$ production,
the case that we focus on in this paper.

%The distribution in mass of the $\PHiggs$ boson pair, $m_{\dihiggs}$, is rather broad in this case.
%Deviations of the $\PHiggs$ boson couplings from their SM values
%induces different interference patterns between the triangle and box diagrams.
%Besides affecting the $\dihiggs$ production cross section,
%the change in interference patterns may  significantly alter the distribution in $m_{\dihiggs}$
%and the distributions in the momenta and angles of the particles reconstructed in the final state.

The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have searched for non-resonant $\dihiggs$ production in the decay channels 
$\dihiggs \to \Pbottom\APbottom\Pbottom\APbottom$, $\Pbottom\APbottom\Pgt\Pgt$, $\Pbottom\APbottom\PW\PW\virt$, $\Pbottom\APbottom\Pgamma\Pgamma$
using the data recorded during LHC Runs $1$ and $2$~\cite{HIG-13-032,HIG-15-013,HIG-17-030,Sirunyan:2020xok,Aad:2015xja,Aaboud:2018knk,Aaboud:2018ftw,Aaboud:2018sfw,Aaboud:2018zhh}.
ATLAS has further performed searches in the decay channels $\dihiggs \to \Pgamma\Pgamma\PW\PW\virt$ and $\PW\PW\virt\PW\PW\virt$~\cite{Aad:2015xja,Aaboud:2018ewm,Aaboud:2018ksn}.
The asterisk ($\virt$) denotes $\PW$ bosons that are off-shell.
Phenomenological studies of non-resonant $\dihiggs$ production are presented in 
Refs.~\cite{Baur:2002rb,Baur:2002qd,Baur:2003gpa,Baur:2003gp,Dolan:2012rv,Papaefstathiou:2012qe,Baglio:2012np,deLima:2014dta,Wardrope:2014kya,Behr:2015oqq,Li:2015yia,Adhikary:2017jtu}.
No evidence for a signal has been found in the LHC data so far.
The present analyses are able to probe the existence of a SM-like $\dihiggs$ signal produced with a cross section of order $10$ times the SM production rate.

The decay channel providing the highest sensitivity for an SM-like $\dihiggs$ signal 
is the $\Pbottom\APbottom\Pgt\Pgt$ channel in case of ATLAS~\cite{Aaboud:2018sfw} and the $\Pbottom\APbottom\Pgamma\Pgamma$ channel in case of CMS~\cite{Sirunyan:2020xok}.
Both channels provide a favorable signal-to-background ratio and are limited mainly by statistical uncertainties at present,
resulting from the limited amount of data that has been recorded so far compared to the small SM $\ggHH$ production cross section.
The channels $\Pbottom\APbottom\Pbottom\APbottom$ and $\Pbottom\APbottom\PW\PW\virt$ provide a significantly larger signal rate,
but suffer from sizeable backgrounds,
arising from QCD multijet production in case of the $\Pbottom\APbottom\Pbottom\APbottom$ channel 
and from top quark pair ($\ttbar$) production in case of the $\Pbottom\APbottom\PW\PW\virt$ channel.
In this paper, we focus on the $\Pbottom\APbottom\PW\PW\virt$ channel.

The separation of the $\dihiggs$ signal from the large $\ttbar$ background constitutes the main experimental challenge in the $\Pbottom\APbottom\PW\PW\virt$ channel.
For a top quark mass of $m_{\Ptop} = 172.8$~\GeV~\cite{PDG},
the cross section for $\ttbar$ production amounts to $825.9^{+46.1}_{-50.5}$~\pb at $\sqrt{s} = 13$~\TeV center-of-mass energy~\cite{Czakon:2011xx}.
The $\ttbar$ background is irreducible in this channel, as it produces the exact same multiplicity of charged leptons, neutrinos, and $\Pbottom$-jets as the $\dihiggs$ signal.
The LO Feynman diagrams for $\ttbar$ production are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ttbar_FeynmanDiagram}.
The main handle to separate the $\dihiggs$ signal from the $\ttbar$ background is the difference in event kinematics,
that is, the differences in the distributions of energies and angles of the charged leptons, $\Pbottom$-jets, and of the missing transverse momentum reconstructed in the event.
The present CMS analysis~\cite{HIG-17-006} utilizes multivariate methods, based on a Deep Neural Network~\cite{ANN,chollet2015keras},
to separate the $\dihiggs$ signal from the $\ttbar$ background, while the current ATLAS analysis~\cite{Aaboud:2018zhh} employs a sequence of hard cuts for this purpose.
In this paper, we propose an alternative multivariate method for the separation of the $\dihiggs$ signal from the $\ttbar$ background,
the matrix element method (MEM)~\cite{Kondo:1988yd,Kondo:1991dw} and apply the method to events in which both $\PW$ bosons decay to charged leptons (electrons or muons),
denoted by the symbol $\Plepton$.

The paper is organized as follows:
In Section~\ref{sec:mem} we describe the MEM and its application to the $\Pbottom\APbottom\PW\PW\virt$ channel.
The performance achieved in separating the $\dihiggs$ signal 
%with SM-like event kinematics 
from the $\ttbar$ background is studied in Section~\ref{sec:performance}.
We conclude the paper with a summary in Section~\ref{sec:summary}.
